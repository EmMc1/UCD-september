    <p><H2>Wonder Woman</H2><img class="Pic2" src="imgs/wonder woman.png"alt="Wonder Woman"><div class="writing"> Wonder Woman is Princess Diana of the immortal Amazons from Greek mythology. Wonder Woman has superhuman strength and speed, as well as the trademark bulletproof bracelets, but it’s probably her Golden Lasso of Truth most people really wish they had.</div></p>

    <p><H2>Superman</H2><img class="Pic2" src="imgs/Superman.png" alt=Superman>Superman has super strength, speed, flight, invulnerability as well as his renowned X-ray and heat vision. The most powerful being on the planet, his amazing abilities are also a melancholy reminder of how different he is from the people he’s dedicated to protect.</p>

    <p><H2>Zatanna</H2><img class="Pic2" src="imgs/Zatanna.png" alt="Zatanna">Intelligent, confident, self-assured and able to manipulate reality itself with her vast magical abilities, Zatanna balances her time as a skilled stage illusionist with battling the dark arts alongside some of the world’s greatest super heroes.</p>
